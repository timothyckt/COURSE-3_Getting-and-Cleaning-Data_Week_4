(1) download zipped data from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" 
then zipped in your local drive

(2) set the file path of source data in Rstudio

(3) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

(4) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

(5) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

(6) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

(7) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## The code file "run_analysis.R" in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data

## The output file "newTidyData.txt" should be the tidy data set

## The file "code book.txt" should be step and variable description
