(1) download zipped data from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" 
then zipped in your local drive

(2) set the file path of source data in Rstudio

(3) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

(4) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

(5) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

(6) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

(7) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### describing the variables : 

## Source file path, for example : "C:/Users/chanti/Documents/2016-09_Big Data/Coursera_Data Analysis/Data Science Specialization/COURSE 3_Getting and Cleaning Data/Week_4/UCI HAR Dataset"

## test data file in "test" folder: (1) "subject_train.txt" (2)"Y_test.txt" (3) "X_test.txt"

## train data file in "trait" folder: (1) "subject_train.txt" (2)"Y_test.txt" (3) "X_test.txt"

## features data file : "features.txt ; with two variables : "featureNum", "featureName"

## activity_labels data file : "activity_labels.txt ; with two variables : "activityNum","activityName"

## Output filename, for example : "newTidyData.txt"
